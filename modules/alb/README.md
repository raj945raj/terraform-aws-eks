## Description

A terraform module to deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Ingress Controller on Amazon EKS cluster.

## AWS region and VPC discovery

ALB Ingress controller Helm chart may discover AWS region and AWS VPC
automatically if `autoDiscoverAwsRegion` and `autoDiscoverAwsVpcID` parameters
are set to `true` (see `settings` input variable). Otherwise, you must set
`awsRegion` and `awsVpcID` parameters in order to deploy the controller.
